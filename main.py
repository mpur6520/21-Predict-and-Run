#Predict and Run Example 1
 # the string "Andy" is stored in a variable, the name "Andy"
 # is then printed (because the variable is printed).

firstName = "Andy"

print(firstName)

#Predict and Run Example 2
 # the string "Colley" is stored into a variable, the variable fullName
# is printed, meaning "Andy Colley" will be printed because of the 
# operation in the fullName variable adding both strings together

lastName = "Colley"

fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

print(fullName)

#Predict and Run Example 3
 # It will output "Hello Andy. Your full name is Andy Colley."

print("Hello " + firstName + ". Your full name is " + fullName + ".")
